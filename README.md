# gnomAD_in_Terra.bio
Repatriating VCF file for a lot of genes or range of genes using gnomAD Hail table in Terra.bio platform 

Retriving vcf file for the wanted genes or ranges in order to do furthur analysis on them using VEP (Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor) or ANNOVAR when the number of ranges exceed a certain amount which you can not do them manually is very hard becase either you need to have a very high storage and/or a high performance machime or you need to use the avalable cloud engines to do so.

personally I suggest you to lookfor a high storage and high performance machine which can reatrive locally but if you did not have this machine, this is the place for you to have progreess in your work but again you have limitation here as well and that's budget.

I assume you know how large the gnomAD files are and I assume you know the gnomad suggestion for it (hail table file) so if not go (this websit)[https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/] and find out yourself https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/
