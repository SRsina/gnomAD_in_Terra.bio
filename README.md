# gnomAD_v3_in_Terra.bio
Repatriating VCF file for a lot of genes or range of genes using gnomAD Hail table in Terra.bio platform 

Retrieving vcf file for the wanted genes or ranges in order to do further analysis on them using VEP (Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor) or ANNOVAR when the number of ranges exceed a certain amount which you can not do them manually is very hard because either you need to have a very high storage and/or a high performance machine or you need to use the available cloud engines to do so.

Personally I suggest you look for a high storage and high performance machine which can retrieve locally but if you did not have this machine, this is the place for you to have progress in your work but again you have limitations here as well and that's budget.

If you are not familiar with Terra.bio or Google cloud I strongly suggest you to read [*This File*](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1I0j3kr5pbtTBZ4qw8SJic0qtUXmAjxieKx9kX3ouI5Y/edit?usp=sharing)
